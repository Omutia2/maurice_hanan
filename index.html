      <h2>Chadwick Boseman's life's timeline:</h2>
      <p>
        Chadwick Aaron Boseman, born on November 29, 1976, was an American actor. He was born and raised in South Carolina where he took up acting professionally after he studied
        directing  at Howard University. He began his career with guest appearances on
        television and was a series regular on the short-lived Lincoln Heights (2008-2009)
        and Persons Unknown (2010). According to film critic Owen Gleiberman in Variety, Boseman was a virtuoso actor who had the rare ability to create a character from the outside
        in and the inside out and he knew how fuse with a role, etching it in three dimansions.
        That's what made him an artist and a movie star.
